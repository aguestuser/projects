# projects

## Scat
* [repo](https://github.com/aguestuser/scat)
* _description_: Chat server in Scala the hard way! Ie: functional and non-blocking without using Actors -- only Futures & hand-rolled wrappers around Java's NIO2 library.

## Supreme Clientele (Work In Progress)
* [repo](https://github.com/aguestuser/supreme_clientelle)
* _description_: Functional, reactive BitTorrent client in Scala. Work in progress, but includes some fun code using parser combinators to decode and encode byte arrays and composed Futures to send them over the wire.

## Lots_O_Info (Work In Progress)
* [repo](https://github.com/the-learning-collective/lots_o_info)
* _description_: Node app to help housing activists track ownership data for NYC real estate. When finished, will synthesize ownership data from 3 different sources (PLUTO, ACRIS, DOB Permits) to infer ownership realtionships not apparent in any one dataset, map those relationships, and allow activists to update those relationships with self-directed research.

## Drivetrain
* [repo](https://github.com/aguestuser/drivetrain)
* _description_: Rails app for the Brooklyn-based bike delivery agency, BK Shift. Matches rider availabilities to restaurant offerings, catches conflicts, offers filterable views of current schedules, and automated emailing of riders of scheduling proposals/confirmations. Has some fun JQuery on the front-end. Coded it all by myself in a 3-month Agile development process -- with no prior knowledge of Ruby or Agile.

## Drivetrain Work Sample 1 (Recursive State Machine)
* [repo](https://github.com/aguestuser/drivetrain_work_sample)
* _description_: Cross-section from my web app, Drivetrain, containing the work from that project which required the most thinking, and of which I am the most proud -- namely a recursive state machine (didn't know to call it that at the time!) that manages multiple possible recursive branches across several HTTP requests.

## Drivetrain Work Sample 2 (Fun With JQuery)
* [repo](https://github.com/aguestuser/drivetrain/blob/0cf4509b2e8ea840c70f4175dfdb33daeabc6d53/app/views/shifts/_clone_week_js.html.haml)
* _description_: Standalone JQuery routine from Drivetrain that provides a dynamic UI to allow users to more easily clone a weekly schedule with several hundred shifts in need of possible modification. Interacts with HAML templates.
